description: Clarify a feature idea or requirement through rounds of questions and write docs/features/<feature>/task.md, the source of truth for the requirement. Use to brainstorm or at the start of a new feature, when a feature request is vague, or when asked to change an existing requirement.
---

# Spark

Goal: turn an idea into a `task.md` that a reviewer agrees with and that later steps (slice,
blueprint) can work from without asking again what the feature is supposed to do.

`task.md` describes **what** and **why**, never **how**. No module, class, or library names unless the
requirement itself demands them (e.g. "must work offline", "must use the existing login").

This skill only writes docs: do not run build, test, lint, or format commands, even if CLAUDE.md lists
checks to run before finishing.

## Process

### 1. Collect the input

Accept any mix of:
- Chat text.
- File paths (markdown, PRD, notes): read them fully.
- Images, screenshots, designs: take only what the requirement needs (screens, states, actions, flow) and
  confirm it. Leave layout, copy, and assets to `mold`; note the design under `Source`.
- Ticket or wiki links: read through an available connector. If none is available, ask the user to paste the content.

If `docs/features/<feature>/task.md` already exists for this feature, go to **Updating task.md** below.

### 2. Light context read

Read only enough of the project to ask good questions: CLAUDE.md, the screens or features the idea touches,
and related existing behavior. The point is to spot conflicts and reuse ("there is already a bookmark
feature — should this extend it?"), not to design the solution.

### 3. Ask in rounds

Ask 2–4 multiple-choice questions per round, with a recommended option first and a short reason. Always
allow a free-text answer. Go through these topics in order, skipping what the input already answers:

1. **Goal** — the user problem, who it is for, how success is judged.
2. **Scope** — what is in, what is explicitly out, which screens/entry points.
3. **Behavior** — main flow step by step, UI states (empty, loading, content, error), user actions and their results.
4. **Edge cases** — no network, empty data, permission denied, interruption (background, rotation, process
   death), very long or missing content, repeated actions, concurrency.
5. **Constraints** — platforms/API levels, offline, performance, accessibility, localization, analytics,
   privacy, existing behavior that must not change.

Rules:
- Never assume an answer silently. If you choose a default, state it and let the user override it.
- Each round builds on the last; don't re-ask what's settled.
- Stop when every topic is either answered or explicitly deferred. Usually 2–4 rounds.

### 4. Confirm the summary

Before writing, post a short summary in chat: goal, in/out of scope, main flow, the acceptance criteria as
one-liners, and open questions. Ask the user to confirm or correct it. Iterate until confirmed.

### 5. Write task.md

Pick a short kebab-case feature slug (confirm it with the user if not obvious) and write
`docs/features/<feature>/task.md`:

```markdown
# <Feature name>

Status: Draft | Confirmed
Source: <chat / file path / ticket link>

## Goal
<Problem, target user, and the outcome in 2–4 sentences.>

## Scope
### In scope
- ...
### Out of scope
- ...

## User flow
1. ...

## UI states
| State | When | What the user sees / can do |

## Acceptance criteria
- **AC-1** <short title>
  - Given ...
  - When ...
  - Then ...

## Edge cases
- **EC-1** <situation> -> <expected behavior>

## Constraints
- ...

## Open questions
- [ ] ... (owner, needed before which step)

## Change log
- <YYYY-MM-DD>: Initial version.
```

Rules for the content:
- Every acceptance criterion is observable and testable by a user or a test; no "should work well".
- IDs (`AC-n`, `EC-n`) are stable: never renumber; mark removed ones `~~AC-3~~ (removed: reason)`.
- Edge cases state the expected behavior, not just the situation.
- UI states say when a state happens and what the user can do; how it looks and its exact copy belong in
  `design.md` (`mold`).
- Keep it to what was agreed. Don't invent requirements the user didn't confirm.

Show the user the path and ask them to review. Set `Status: Confirmed` only when they approve.

### 6. Finish

Suggest the next step without running it:
- A design or flow exists (Figma link, screenshots, draw.io): `mold` first, then the steps below.
- Large task (several screens, several layers, or more than one reviewable diff): `slice`.
- Small task: `blueprint` directly on task.md.

## Updating task.md

When the user asks to change the requirement (in chat or with new material):
1. Read the current task.md.
2. Ask questions only about what the change leaves unclear, in the same round style.
3. Show the proposed changes as a short list (added / changed / removed, with IDs) and wait for approval.
4. Apply them, keep IDs stable, add a Change log line, and set `Status: Draft` until re-approved.
5. If `design.md`, `subtasks/`, or `implement-plans/` exist next to task.md, list the ones affected by the
   change and suggest updating them (`mold` for design.md). Do not edit them yourself.
