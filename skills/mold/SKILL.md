name: mold
description: Read a feature's design once (Figma link, screenshots, or draw.io) and write docs/features/<feature>/design.md plus one file per screen, covering layout, states, copy, navigation, and assets, so later steps never re-read the design. Use after spark when a design or flow exists, or when the design changes.

# Mold

Goal: turn the design into text that slice, blueprint, and forge can work from without opening the design
again, and that a reviewer can check against the design in one pass.

The design is read **once**, here. The output describes **what the UI looks like and how it moves**, never
how to build it: no module, class, or Composable names. Mapping design names to code is `blueprint`'s job.

`task.md` holds the rules (what and why); `design.md` holds the presentation (layout, copy, transitions).
Never copy requirements into design.md; link to `AC-n` / `EC-n` instead.

This skill only writes docs and fetches design files: do not run build, test, lint, or format commands, even
if CLAUDE.md lists checks to run before finishing. Do not touch `res/` or any source set; `forge` moves
assets into the project.

Do not re-ask anything answered in the linked task.md.

## Output

```
docs/features/<feature>/
  design.md                 # index: sources, screen list, navigation, assets, cross-check
  screens/
    <screen>.md             # one per screen: layout, states, components, copy, notes
    <screen>.png            # screenshot of the default state
    <screen>-<state>.png    # screenshots of other states
  assets/                   # raw exported files: svg, png, lottie json
```

The structure is the same for every feature, even a one-screen one, so later skills never branch on it.

## Process

### 1. Collect the input

- Read `docs/features/<feature>/task.md`. If it doesn't exist, suggest `spark` first and stop. If it is
  Draft, warn the user and continue.
- If `design.md` already exists, go to **Updating** below.
- Accept any mix of: Figma links, screenshots or exported images, `.drawio` files, designer notes.
- No design at all: tell the user this skill needs one, and stop.

### 2. Read the design once

**Figma link**: read [figma.md](figma.md) and follow it for access, token rules, and fetching.

**Screenshots and draw.io** are read directly, no setup needed:
- Expect one screen per image. Propose a mapping of images to screens and states (from file names such as
  `bookmark-list-empty.png`, or from what you see for names like `IMG_2031.png` or an image holding several
  screens) and confirm it in one question. Copy each image into `screens/` under its final name; keep a
  multi-screen image whole as `screens/<feature>-flow.png`.
- Copy is read by eye: small text and Vietnamese diacritics are error-prone. Ask whether a text source
  exists (strings file, spreadsheet).
- Colors, sizes, and spacing are estimates only. Map them to the nearest theme token from step 3 and note
  `(estimated)`; never write a hex or dp value as if it were exact.
- Assets cannot be extracted from pixels: anything not matched in step 3 is `needs-export`.
- For `.drawio`, read every node, edge with its label, decision branch, and note.

Mark anything illegible `⚠ unreadable` instead of guessing.

Classify what you find:

| In the design | Becomes |
|---|---|
| Frame or image of one screen | A screen |
| Frames named `<Screen> / <State>`, images named `<screen>-<state>` | States of that screen |
| Dark, landscape, tablet, large-font, or RTL frame of a screen | A Variants row of that screen |
| Prototype interaction | A Navigation row, `Source: prototype` |
| Drawn arrow, connector, or `.drawio` edge | A Navigation row, `Source: drawn ⚠` |
| No flow in the design | Rows proposed from task.md and the screens, `Source: proposed` until confirmed |
| Text or sticky note beside a frame | Notes of that screen, verbatim |
| Icon, illustration, image, animation | A row in the Assets table |

### 3. Match against the project

Read only enough to name things that already exist: CLAUDE.md, the design system module, the theme
(color / typography / spacing token names), and `res/drawable*` / icon sets. Use this to:
- Mark assets that already exist (`exists`) or come from an icon library (`reuse`) instead of exporting.
- Name tokens by their names in code when a clear match exists; otherwise by their Figma style name, or
  as the nearest code token marked `(estimated)` when read from an image.

### 4. Cross-check

List every mismatch between screens, flow, and task.md:
- A screen no flow leads to.
- A flow destination with no screen design.
- A state with no way out (error without retry, dead end without back).
- A trigger in the flow with no matching control on the screen.
- A UI state or flow step that task.md requires but the design doesn't show, and the reverse.

### 5. Ask in rounds

Ask 2–4 multiple-choice questions per round, recommended option first with a short reason, about the
cross-check items and anything ambiguous: missing states, unreadable copy, assets with no source, drawn or
proposed flow. Always allow a free-text answer. An unanswered item stays under Open questions.

### 6. Write the files

Use the templates below. Rules:
- **Screen file names follow the design**, not code: the Figma frame name or the confirmed image name,
  slugified to kebab-case, with numbering prefixes dropped and diacritics removed
  (`01 - Bookmark List` → `bookmark-list`).
- **Stable key**: the Figma node id when the source is Figma; the screen file name otherwise. Store it in
  the screen file so updates find the right file.
- **Copy is verbatim**, including punctuation. Placeholder copy in wireframes is marked `_placeholder_`.
- **No duplication**: Navigation and Assets live only in design.md; screen files list asset names only.
  A component used on several screens is described in the first screen that uses it and referenced by name
  elsewhere.
- Set `Fidelity`: `wireframe` (no final copy, colors, or assets), `mockup`, or `final`.
- **Variants**: fill the table for dark, landscape / tablet, and large font (add RTL if task.md needs it).
  `no` means not designed, not "not needed"; if task.md requires a variant the design lacks, list it in
  Cross-check.

Show the user the paths with a short summary (screens and states, asset counts by status, open questions)
and ask them to review. Set `Status: Confirmed` only when they approve.

### 7. Finish

- If the design revealed requirements task.md lacks (a confirm dialog, a back-stack rule, a new state),
  list them and suggest updating task.md through `spark`. Do not edit task.md yourself.
- Suggest the next step without running it: `slice` for a large task, otherwise `blueprint`.

## Updating

When the design changes (new link, new images, or `update` in the request):
1. Read the current design.md and screen files.
2. Find what changed. Figma gives no per-frame change date, so re-fetch only the structure (frame ids,
   names, sizes, text) for the link and compare it with the screen files by stable key; images are
   compared by name and by eye with the saved screenshots. Fetch details and screenshots only for the
   frames that differ. If a Figma frame was renamed, ask whether to rename the file; if a new image
   matches no screen, ask whether it is a new screen or a renamed one.
3. Show the changes as a short list (screens, states, navigation, assets: added / changed / removed) and
   wait for approval.
4. Apply them, add a Change log line, update `Captured`, and set `Status: Draft` until re-approved.
5. If `subtasks/` or `implement-plans/` exist next to task.md, list the ones affected and suggest updating
   them (`slice` for subtasks, `blueprint` for plans). Do not edit them yourself.
